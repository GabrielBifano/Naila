# üó®Ô∏è Naila - Simple Chatbot Flask API with RAG

This project is a **Flask-based chatbot API** that integrates **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with **CrewAI** and **Groq‚Äôs LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instant** model.  
It allows you to ask questions via a simple chat interface, and the backend uses both a local knowledge base and a language model to generate answers.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Flask web server with **Socket.IO** for real-time chat.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using:
  - Knowledge from local .txt scrape file
  - Website data (`https://www.signa.pt/`)
- LLM inference via **Groq API**.
- Cross-platform setup scripts:
  - **Linux/macOS:** `run.sh`
  - **Windows (PowerShell):** `run.ps1`

---

## üì¶ What you will need
- Python **3.12+**
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- API keys:
  - **Hugging Face API Key** (if using Hugging Face models)
  - **Groq API Key** (for LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instant)

## üîß Quick Setup & Running

### API keys setup

You will need two API keys for this project: **Groq** and **Huggingface** both free and easy to setup.
There are two scripts in the project: **run.sh** and **run.ps1**, for Linux and Windows respectively. Open the disered one for your case in a code editor (we recommend using the Linux .sh). You will find the following commented lines:
```
# # Uncomment the code below if you do not have your
# # API keys as environment variables in your system:

# echo "Setting API key variables"
# export HF_API_KEY="your_huggingface_key"
# export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_key"
```
To run the server it is necessary to export your API keys for **Groq** and **Huggingface** as environment variables. For that, uncomment the code above and substitute your keys, for example:
```
echo "Setting API key variables"
export HF_API_KEY="hf_abcdefghijklmnopq..."
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_abcdefghijklmnopq..."
```

### üêß Linux / macOS
**Recommended.** Run the provided bash script:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
source ./run.sh
```

### ü™ü Windows (PowerShell)
**Not recommended.** You may find version incompatibilities.
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
. .\run.ps1
```

### üåç Running the Server without script

If the scripts provided before are not working, or you prefer doing it by hand, use the following steps to setup and run the project:

Create a virtual environment (.nailavenv) if it doesn‚Äôt exist:
```
python3 -m venv .nailavenv
```

Activate the environment:
```
source .nailavenv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies with requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, if for some ungodly reason, the line above doesn't work:
```
pip install flask flask-socketio langchain langchain-community langchain-huggingface langchain-groq crewai sentence-transformers faiss-cpu beautifulsoup4
```

Run the app with (make sure .nailavenv is active):
```
python3 app.py
```
